## Ways to load code.
[Ways to load code](https://practicingruby.com/articles/ways-to-load-code?u=dc2ab0f9bb)

load, autoload, require and require_relative.

#### Load Path
Ruby will look in it's $LOAD_PATH global variable for a list of 
directories to look for ruby files.

***Open pry and look at the $LOAD_PATH***

<code>
pry(main)> $LOAD_PATH
</code>

<code>
pry(main)> $:
</code>

#### Kernel#load
This will reload the ruby file every time it's called. Good for debugging.

<code>
pry(main)> load 'calendar.rb'
</code>

change the file 

<code>
pry(main)> load './calendar.rb'
</code>

notice the changes

<code>
pry(main)> load './calendar'
</code>

Must have the .rb on the file name to load.

#### Kernel#require
This will load a ruby file ONCE. All subsequent require statements will not
load the file.

*Doesn't need the .rb file extension, but won't hurt if it's there.
*Does need the relative path './'.

<code>
pry(main)> require './calendar'
</code>

change the file 

<code>
pry(main)> require './calendar'
</code>

notice the changes are NOT seen!

#### Kernel#require_relative
Problem with Kernel#relative is that the relative path is relative to where ruby was invoked/executed. Its not relative to where the file resides.

In the show_person.rb file we use this require to try to load the Person class.

<code>
require './lib/person'
...
</code>

When we run this in the root directory of this project it will work. Because it's looking for the file defining the Person class, person.rb, in the child directory 'lib'.

<code>
$ ruby bin/show_person.rb
</code>

OK, if we run it in the root directory

<code>
$ cd bin
</code>

If we cd into the bin directory and try to run this it will fail.

<code>
$ ruby show_person.rb
</code>

Fails, it's looking for the file in bin/lib/person.rb
    `require': cannot load such file -- ./lib/person (LoadError)

The fix is to use require_relative. This will try to find the file relative to the file that has that has the require_relative statement.

<ul>In bin/show_person.rb:
<li>uncomment require_relative '../lib/person'</li>
<li>comment out require './lib/person'</li>
</ul>

<code>
$ ruby bin/show_person.rb
</code>

Still OK, if run it in the root directory.

<code>
$ cd bin
</code>

<code>
$ ruby show_person.rb  
</code>

Still OK

<code>
$ cd ../tmp
</code>

<code>
$ ruby ../bin/show_person.rb
</code>

Still OK.

You may run across an older hack for this problem. It adds the current directory of the file in the Ruby load path. DON'T USE THIS.

<code>
$LOAD_PATH.unshift("#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/../lib")
</code>

## LAB

### Change code and see how load, require and require_relative behave.
* Create Person class, in the lib dir, that has name and age attributes. It will also have a method to determine if person can vote. Initially a person can vote if the are over 18.
* Open pry and "load" this person class.
* Create a person that is age 19.
* Can they vote?
* Now change the person class so that the voting age is now 21.
* load the person class. Was the change seen?
* Do the above for require and require relative.

### Create a make_voters.rb file in the bin directory. 
This will create voters of different ages, some to young to vote.

* In the bin/make_voters.rb file add this to the top of file. require '../lib/person'
* Run the command from the root directory "ruby bin/make_voters.rb"  
* Run the command from the bin directory "cd bin; ruby make_voters.rb"
* Run the command from your HOME directory "cd ~; ruby your path here/make_voters.rb"
* Change the require in this file to require_relative and do the above.
